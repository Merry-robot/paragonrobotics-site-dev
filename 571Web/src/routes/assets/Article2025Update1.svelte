<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">2025 Robot Update 1</h1>
<p> <br> We recently got a Swerve Drive Mechanism for our robot. 
    This allows for a very percise and agile movement system. 
    It is very useful for our robot to be able to move around 
    the arena with very precise movements. We are currently 
    working on the software for the Swerve Drive Mechanism. <br> <br> Early Febuary 2025</p>
